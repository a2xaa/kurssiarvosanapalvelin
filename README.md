**Kurssiarvosanapalvelin**

Implemented a Node.js and Express server that can:

Accept course results in CSV format and save them to a JSON file, which is loaded when the server starts.

Retrieve from the JSON file:

All participants’ names and grades for a given course

All courses and grades for a given student

A specific student’s grade for a specific course

A form was created to allow users to input the course name and/or student name for searching.

**Installation**
- Clone the repository
- Run `npm install`
- Start the server with `node index.js`
